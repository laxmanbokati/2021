    title: Research Statement
    summary: |
      In many real life scenarios we often have to make decisions based on imperfect observations or with unknown
      outcomes. My research explores theory behind such decision making models and explains that seemingly odd
      behaviors and patterns can have perfectly reasonable and mathematical explanations.
